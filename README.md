Open source peer library for the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP, RFC 4975) in C#

This project's goal is to develop an open source peer library for the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP: RFC 4975, and relay extensions: RFC 4976) for usage in .Net projects written entirely in C#, flexible enough that it can be used by any application.

The Library is a port of the Java MSRP Library, maintained by Tom Uijldert and its founder Jo√£o Antunes.

The goal was to keep this code as close as possible to the original Java-Code, but with C# features like Properties properly used. To accomplish this the library has some ported code from Java and some util-classes to make this happen.
